# TerminalSongs🎵

Terminal-based ASCII art visualizations synchronized to snippets of music. Each song features custom animations and timing that sync with the music when you play it alongside the visual.

## About
This is a little side project I'm working on that combines my love for music with my passion for programming.
The goal is to figure out the timing of beat changes, transitions, and tempo of specific songs, and map them to ASCII art animations (basically an ASCII music video).

## Songs

### Television Rules the Nation / Crescendolls - Daft Punk
This song is inspiration for, and the first song of this project. Something about combining music created by robots and programming just felt right. 
I used the silver and gold helmet robots to represent the 2 different robot voices in the song respectively. When one robot is speaking, their helmet is displayed on the screen, while the other is hidden.
When their parts meet, both helmets are displayed on the screen simultaneously, displaying the full ASCII art.

**Usage:**
```bash
python trtn.py
```
1. Sync starts at 0:15
2. Run the script above
3. Press ENTER exactly when the music starts
4. Enjoy the synchronized visualization

**Note:** Currently runs buggy in Mac Terminal (screen scrolling issues). Works properly in VS Code terminal. Planning to fix all terminal compatibility in the future.
